Calculations of point particle capture efficiency in model 2d flows.

The main output currently is the two figures for our upcoming manuscript.
Run via:

    python fig1-schematics.py

and

    python fig2-phase-portraits.py

And these should output the figures as pdfs and pngs in the working directory.

Bonus figure, showing transition from exp scaling to normal (square root) scaling of capture efficiency as initial conditions are rescaled in the inviscid flow case:

    python inviscid-efficiency-vs-ics.py data/inviscid_eff_*

The prepackaged data was previously generated via:

    python efficiency.py 0.1 > data/efficiency_kuwabara_alpha=0.1.csv
    python efficiency.py -f stokes > data/efficiency_stokes.csv
    python efficiency.py -f shm > data/efficiency_shm.csv

Out of date, need to update:

    for gamma in 1.2 1.8 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 5.0 10.0; do python efficiency.py --flow inviscid --scalefac $gamma --maxdeltastokes 1.0 --dump > data/efficiency_inviscid_gamma=$gamma.csv; done
